# Dissertation

The code is for Yeheng Qu's dissertation of Application of Convolutional Neural Network on Crop Classification of Sentinel-2A Images in Northern Region in Ghana. 
The code is developed based on the code in the eye-in-the-sky in manideep2510.
The code is divided into two parts, one for U-net and another for FCN.
Some training samples and testing results are provided as well, but they are just samples rather than the actual output in the experiment.

The code of FCN training and testing, transforming images to input arrays, and one-hot part are developed by me on the basis of the code in the manideep2510.
